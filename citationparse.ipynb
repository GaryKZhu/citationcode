      " Sparsely-spread CDMA - a statistical mechanics based analysis Jack Raymond and David Saad Neural Computation Research Group, Aston University, Aston Triangle, Birmingham, B4 7EJ jack.raymond@physics.org Sparse Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), a variation on the standard CDMA method in which the spreading (signature) matrix contains only a relatively small number of non-zero elements, is presented and analysed using methods of statistical physics.\n",
      "The analysis provides results on the performance of maximum likelihood decoding for sparse spreading codes in the large system limit.\n",
      "We present results for both cases of regular and irregular spreading matrices for the binary additive white Gaussian noise channel (BIAWGN) with a comparison to the canonical (dense) random spreading code.\n",
      "64.60.Cn, 75.10.Nr, 84.40.Ua, 89.70.+c 68P30,82B44,94A12,94A14 2020/09/07 07:31:42 Background The area of multiuser communications is one of great interest from both theoretical and engineering perspectives 1 CITE.\n",
      "Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) is a particular method for allowing multiple users to access channel resources in an efficient and robust manner, and plays an important role in the current preferred standards for allocating channel resources in wireless communications.\n",
      "CDMA utilises channel resources highly efficiently by allowing many users to transmit on much of the bandwidth simultaneously, each transmission being encoded with a user specific signature code.\n",
      "Disentangling the information in the channel is possible by using the properties of these codes and much of the focus in CDMA research is on developing efficient codes and decoding methods.\n",
      "In this paper we study a variant of the original method, sparse CDMA, where the spreading matrix contains only a relatively small number of non-zero elements as was originally studied and motivated in 1 CITE.\n",
      "While the straightforward application of sparse CDMA techniques to uplink multiple access communication is rather limited, as it is difficult to synchronise the sparse transmissions from the various users, the method can be highly useful for frequency and time hopping.\n",
      "In frequency-hopping code division multiple access (FH-CDMA), one repeatedly switches frequencies during radio transmission, often to minimize the effectiveness of interception or jamming of telecommunications.\n",
      "At any given time step, each user occupies a small (finite) number of the (infinite) FORMULA -ary frequency-shift-keying (MFSK) chip/carrier pairs (with gain FORMULA, the total number of chip-frequency pairs is FORMULA.)\n",
      "Hops between available frequencies can be either random or preplanned and take place after the transmission of data on a narrow frequency band.\n",
      "In time-hopping (TH-)CDMA, a pseudo-noise sequence defines the transmission moment for the various users, which can be viewed as sparse CDMA when used in an ultra-wideband impulse communication system.\n",
      "In this case the sparse time-hopping sequences reduces collisions between transmissions.\n",
      "This study follows the seminal paper of Tanaka 1 CITE, and other recent extensions 2 CITE, in utilising the replica analysis for randomly spread CDMA with discrete inputs, which established many of the properties of random densely-spread CDMA with respect to several different detectors including Maximum A Posteriori (MAP), Marginal Posterior Maximiser (MPM) and minimum mean square-error (MMSE).\n",
      "Sparsely-spread CDMA differs from the conventional CDMA, based on dense spreading sequences, in that any user only transmits to a small number of chips (by comparison to transmission on all chips in the case of dense CDMA).\n",
      "The sparse nature of this model facilitates the use of methods from statistical physics of dilute disordered systems 1 CITE, 2 CITE for studying the properties of typical cases.\n",
      "The feasibility of sparse CDMA for transmitting information was recently demonstrated 1 CITE for the c approximation; several results have been reported for the case of random transmission patterns.\n",
      "In a separate recent study, based on the belief propagation inference algorithm and a binary input prior distribution, sparse CDMA has also been considered as a route to proving results in the densely spread CDMA 1 CITE.\n",
      "In addition, this study demonstrated the existence of a waterfall phenomenon comparable to the dense code for a subset of ensembles.\n",
      "The waterfall phenomenon is observed in decoding techniques, where there is a dynamical transition between two statistically distinct solutions as the noise parameter is varied.\n",
      "Finally we note a number of pertinent studies concerning the effectiveness of belief propagation as an MPM decoding method 1 CITE, 2 CITE, 3 CITE, 4 CITE, and in combining sparse encoding (LDPC) methods with CDMA 5 CITE.\n",
      "Many of these papers however consider the extreme dilution regime – in which the number of chip contributions is large but not FORMULA.\n",
      "The theoretical work regarding sparsely spread CDMA remained lacking in certain respects.\n",
      "As pointed out in 1 CITE, spreading codes with Poisson distributed number of non-zero elements, per chip and across users, are systematically failing in that each user has some probability of not contributing to any chips (transmitting no information).\n",
      "Even in the “partly regular” code 1 CITE ensemble (where each user transmits on the same number of chips) some chips have no contributors owing to the Poisson distribution in chip connectivity, consequently the bandwidth is not effectively utilised.\n",
      "We circumvent this problem by introducing constraints to prevent this, namely taking regular signature codes constrained such that both the number of users per chip and chips per user take fixed integer values.\n",
      "Furthermore we present analytic and numerical analysis without resort to Gaussian approximations of any quantities.\n",
      "Using new tools from statistical mechanics we are able to cast greater light on the nature of the binary prior transmission process.\n",
      "Notably the nature of the decoding state space and relative performance of sparse ensembles versus dense ones across a range of noise levels; and importantly, the question of how the coexistence of solutions found by Tanaka 1 CITE extends to sparse ensembles, especially close to the transition points determined for the dense ensemble.\n",
      "In this paper we demonstrate the superiority of regular sparsely spread CDMA code over densely spread codes in certain respects, for example, the anticipated bit error rate arising in decoding is improved in the high noise regime and the solution coexistence behaviour is less pervasive.\n",
      "Furthermore, to utilise belief propagation for such an ensemble is certain to be significantly faster and less computationally demanding 1 CITE, this also has power-consumption implications which may be important in some applications.\n",
      "Other practical issues of implementation, the most basic being non-synchronisation and power control, require detailed study and may make fully harnessing these advantages more complex and application dependent.\n",
      "The paper is organised as follows: In section  we will introduce the general framework and notation used, while the methodology used for the various codes will be presented in section .\n",
      "The main results for the various codes will be presented in section  followed by concluding remarks in section .\n",
      "The model FIGURE We consider a standard model of CDMA consisting of FORMULA users transmitting in a bit interval of FORMULA chips.\n",
      "We assume a model with perfect power control and synchronisation, and consider only the single bit interval.\n",
      "In our case the received signal FORMULA is described by FORMULA where the vector components describe the values for distinct chips: FORMULA is the spreading code for user FORMULA, FORMULA is the bit sent by user FORMULA (binary input symbols) and FORMULA the noise vector.\n",
      "Appropriate normalisation of the power is through the definition of the signature matrix (FORMULA).\n",
      "It is possible to include a user or chip specific amplitude variation, which may be due to fading or imperfect power control.\n",
      "We consider a model without these effects.\n",
      "The spreading codes are sparse so that in expectation only FORMULA of the elements in vector FORMULA are non-zero.\n",
      "If, with knowledge of the signature matrix in use, we assume the signal has been subject to additive white Gaussian channel noise of variance FORMULA, where FORMULA is the variance of the true channel noise FORMULA, we can write the posterior for the transmitted bits FORMULA (unknowns given the particular instance) using Bayes Theorem FORMULA and from this define bit error rate, mutual information, and other quantities.\n",
      "The statistical mechanics approach from here is to define a Hamiltonian and partition function from which the various statistics relating to this probability distribution may be determined - and hence all the usual information theory measures.\n",
      "A suitable choice for the Hamiltonian is FORMULA.\n",
      "The other quenched variables (parameters), describing the instance of the disorder, are the signature matrix (FORMULA), noise (FORMULA) and the inputs (FORMULA).\n",
      "The variables FORMULA describe our prior beliefs about the inputs (the specific user bias), and we can assume some simple distribution for this such as all users having the same bias FORMULA.\n",
      "Maximal rate transmission corresponds to unbiased bits FORMULA, and this is considered throughout the paper.\n",
      "The properties of such a system may be reflected in a factor (Tanner) graph, a bipartite graph in which users and chips are represented by nodes (see figure REF).\n",
      "The calculation we undertake is specific to the case of the thermodynamic limit in which the number of chips FORMULA whilst the load FORMULA is fixed.\n",
      "Note that FORMULA is termed FORMULA in many CDMA papers, here we reserve FORMULA to mean the “inverse temperature” in a statistical mechanics sense (which defines our prior belief for the noise level and give rise to the corresponding MAP detector.)\n",
      "In all ensembles we may identify the parameter FORMULA as the mean number of contributions to each chip, and FORMULA as the mean number of contributions per user.\n",
      "As such the following also holds FORMULA.\n",
      "The calculations presented henceforth are specific to the case of memoryless noise, drawn from a single distribution of mean zero and mean square FORMULA FORMULA.\n",
      "Code Ensembles We consider several code ensembles we call irregular, partly regular and regular, which differ in the constraints placed on the factor and variable degree constraints of the signature matrix FORMULA.\n",
      "The probability distribution FORMULA where FORMULA is a normalising constant, FORMULA is the factor degree probability distribution of mean FORMULA, FORMULA is the variable degree probability distribution of mean FORMULA, and FORMULA is the marginal probability distribution which is common to all ensembles FORMULA.\n",
      "The gain factor FORMULA, is drawn randomly from a single distribution with zero measure at FORMULA, and finite moments, in any instance of a code FORMULA.\n",
      "We here investigate the case of Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) which corresponds to a uniform distribution on FORMULA, though the analytic results presented are applicable to any distribution of mean square FORMULA.\n",
      "Note that disorder in the gain factors is not a necessity, the case FORMULA also allows decoding in sparse ensembles.\n",
      "The case where FORMULA and FORMULA are Poissonian distributed identifies the irregular ensemble - where the connections between chips and users are independently distributed.\n",
      "The second distribution called partly regular has FORMULA, in which the chip connectivity is again Poisson distributed with mean FORMULA, but each user contributes to exactly FORMULA chips.\n",
      "This prevents the systematic failure inherent in the irregular ensemble since therein an extensive number of users fail to transmit on any chips.\n",
      "If in addition to the aforementioned constraint all chips receive exactly FORMULA contributions, FORMULA, the ensemble is called regular.\n",
      "Regular chip connectivity amongst other things prevents the systematic inefficiency due to leaving some chips unaccessed by any of the users.\n",
      "The case of Poissonian distributions is that in which there is no global control.\n",
      "In many engineering applications constraining users individually (non-Poissonian FORMULA) is practical, whereas coordination between users (non-Poissonian FORMULA) is difficult.\n",
      "The practicalities of implementing the different ensembles we consider are application specific: the advantages inherent in distributing channel resources more evenly amongst users may be lost to practical implentation problems.\n",
      "Methodology Spectral Efficiency Lower Bound The inferiority of codes with Poissonian user connectivity has been pointed out previously (e.g., in 1 CITE), based on the understanding that codes which leave a portion of the users disconnected cannot be optimal.\n",
      "Analogously we argue that codes with irregular chip connectivity must also be inferior in that they leave a fraction of the chips (bandwidth) unutilised, thus providing a motivation for considering fully regular codes.\n",
      "In this section we show a particular case in which the regular codes are expected to outperform any other ensemble by analysing the amount of information that can be extracted on the sent bits by consideration of only one chip in isolation of the other chips.\n",
      "This corresponds to a detector reconstructing bits based only on the value of a single chip, and is independent of the user connectivity.\n",
      "The spectral efficiency is defined as the mutual information between the received signal and reconstructed bits per chip.\n",
      "In considering only a single chip (FORMULA) we have FORMULA where the subscript zero indicates that the true (generative), rather than model (REF), probability distribution.\n",
      "For brevity we consider the simplest case that the generative and model probability distributions are the same with unbiased bits and a Gaussian noise distribution in which case after some rearrangement FORMULA where FORMULA are the bits connected to chip FORMULA, and the chip Hamiltonian is FORMULA labelling each interacting (non-zero) component on the chip by FORMULA, FORMULA being the chip connectivity.\n",
      "Working from this description we wish to compare the performance of ensembles with different chip connectivities.\n",
      "To do this we consider the ensemble average mutual information by averaging the mutual information over the connectivities (FORMULA), load factors, and transmitted bits.\n",
      "This average is complicated, however it is possible to calculate the dominant terms in the low and high FORMULA limits.\n",
      "In the case of low noise (FORMULA) we find the asymptotically dominant terms come first from the numerator FORMULA which is an average over the ground state energy, and also the logarithm of the denominator which is FORMULA where FORMULA has been decomposed into its bit (FORMULA) and noise (FORMULA) parts, and the averages are now over the ensembles as well as FORMULA.\n",
      "The first part of (REF) gives an energy contribution cancelling (REF).\n",
      "We call the remaining part the average over the chip entropy, by comparison with (REF) this determines the amount of information lost in decoding.\n",
      "The chip entropy term contains an indicator function counting the ground states - the average chip entropy is zero when FORMULA is the only solution.\n",
      "For the case of FORMULA however there may be some degeneracy in ground states with two terms in the sum being non-zero but cancelling one another.\n",
      "This degeneracy has a dependence on the distribution FORMULA for given FORMULA.\n",
      "Averaging over load factors and transmitted bits we find that in the zero noise limit FORMULA.\n",
      "This is because chip entropy, when averaged over load factors and bits is a concave function in FORMULA, so that the information loss is minimised when FORMULA.\n",
      "This dependency on FORMULA may be a peculiarity of the detector considered, but many other aspects of the calculation may be generalised to give a similar result.\n",
      "It is possible to consider the opposite limit FORMULA perturbatively.\n",
      "We found that the leading four orders in FORMULA were identical for all code ensembles of the same mean chip connectivity.\n",
      "We would anticipate the behaviour at non-extreme FORMULA to fall somewhere between these two regimes and thus for the chip regular ensemble to be atleast as good as the chip irregular ensembles.\n",
      "We note here that another reason for considering the regular code optimal amongst sparse random codes is to consider the field term when the Hamiltonian (REF) is written in canonical form with a set of couplings (FORMULA) and user specific external fields (FORMULA).\n",
      "In this representation the set of external fields are in expectation aligned with the sent bit sequence, but subject to fluctuations for each code instance.\n",
      "The variance of these fluctuations may be shown to be proportional to the excess chip connectivity over the true chip connectivity 1 CITE, which amongst all ensembles is minimised by the regular chip ensemble.\n",
      "The multi-user interference is larger in irregular codes and hence information recovery is weaker as predicted in this section.This argument is added since published version.\n",
      "Replica Method Outline We determine the static properties of our model defined in section, including correlations due to the full interaction structure, we use the replica method.\n",
      "From the expression of the Hamiltonian (REF) we may identify a free energy and partition function as: FORMULA.\n",
      "The assumption being that in the large system limit any two randomly selected instances will, with high probability, have indistinguishable statistical properties.\n",
      "This assumption has firm foundation in several related problems 1 CITE, and is furthermore intuitive after some reflection.\n",
      "If this assumption is true then the statists of any particular instance can be described completely by the free energy averaged over all instances of the disorder.\n",
      "We are thus interested in the quantity FORMULA where the angled brackets represent the weighted averages over FORMULA (the instances).\n",
      "The entropy density may be calculated from the free energy density by use of the relation FORMULA where FORMULA is the energy density.\n",
      "To determine the free energy we must average over disorder in (REF), which is a difficult problem except in special cases.\n",
      "This is why we make use of the replica identity FORMULA.\n",
      "The discreteness of replicas is essential in the first part of the calculation, but a continuation to the real numbers is required in taking FORMULA – this is a notorious assumption, which rigorous mathematics can not yet justify for the general case, in spite of the progress made in recent years 1 CITE, 2 CITE, 3 CITE.\n",
      "However, we shall assume validity and since the methodology for the sparse structures is well established 1 CITE, 2 CITE, 3 CITE we omit our particular details.\n",
      "The final functional form for the free energy is determlained from FORMULA where FORMULA is a constant due to normalising the ensembles (REF).\n",
      "This expression may be evaluated at the saddle point to give an expression for the free energy.\n",
      "In the term (REF) we account for the cases in which the marginalised probability distribution FORMULA and assumed marginal probability distribution (described by FORMULA) are asymmetric.\n",
      "In the case of maximal rate which we will consider, the FORMULA average is trivial and FORMULA.\n",
      "Provided that in addition the gain factor distribution is symmetric then it is possible to remove the FORMULA dependence in the order parameters, since the symmetry FORMULA and FORMULA leaves the free energy invariant.\n",
      "Replica Symmetric Equations The concise form for our equations is attained using the assumption of replica symmetry (RS).\n",
      "This amounts to the assumption that the correlations amongst replicas are all identical, and determined by a unique shared distribution.\n",
      "The validity of this assumption may be self consistently tested (section REF).\n",
      "This assumption differs from that used by Yoshida and Tanaka 1 CITE where the correlations are described by only a handful of parameters rather than a distribution once RS is assumed – this approach may therefore miss some of the detailed structure although it is easier to handle numerically.\n",
      "The order parameter in our case is given by FORMULA where FORMULA is a variational normalisation constant and FORMULA are normalised distributions on the interval FORMULA.\n",
      "From here onwards we may consider the case in which the bit variables FORMULA and gain factors FORMULA are gauged to FORMULA (FORMULA, FORMULA).\n",
      "Using Laplace's method, this gives the following expression for the (RS) free energy at the saddle point FORMULA where FORMULA and the saddle point value for FORMULA (FORMULA) has been introduced.\n",
      "The averages over FORMULA and FORMULA encapsulate the differences amongst the ensembles.\n",
      "Equation () describes the interaction at a single chip in the factor graph (figure REF) of connectivity FORMULA.\n",
      "The parameter FORMULA and variable FORMULA are the gain factors, and reconstructed bits respectively, both gauged to the transmitted bit, while FORMULA is the instance of the chip noise.\n",
      "The order variational distributions FORMULA are chosen so as to extremise (REF).\n",
      "The self consistent equations attained by the saddle point method are: FORMULA.\n",
      "For regularly constrained ensembles the chip and user excesses are FORMULA and FORMULA respectively.\n",
      "For Poissonian distributions the excess degree distribution is the full degree distribution.\n",
      "Aside from entropy, the other quantities of interest may be determined from the probability distribution for the overlap of reconstructed and sent variables FORMULA, FORMULA.\n",
      "This approach is a probabilistic one and hence more intuitive on some levels.\n",
      "Population Dynamics Analysis of these equations is primarily constrained by the nature of equations (REF -).\n",
      "No exact solutions are apparent, and perturbative regimes about the ferromagnetic solution (which is only a solution for zero noise) are difficult to handle.\n",
      "Consequently we use population dynamics 1 CITE – representing the distributions FORMULA by finite populations (histograms) and iterating this distribution until convergence.\n",
      "It is hoped, and observed, that each histogram captures sufficient detail to describe the continuous function and the dynamics (described below) allow convergence towards a true solution distribution with only small corrections due to finite size effects.\n",
      "To solve the equations (REF,) with population dynamics finite histograms constucted from FORMULA undirected cavity magnetisations are used.\n",
      "Histograms approximating each function are formed FORMULA with FORMULA sufficiently large to provide good resolution in the desired performance measures.\n",
      "The discrete minimisation dynamics of the histograms is derived from (REF -).\n",
      "Histogram updates are undertaken alternately, with all magnetisation in the histogram being updated sequentially.\n",

      "The iteration of the histograms implicit in (REF -REF) is analogous to the propagation of a population of cavity magnetisations between factor (FORMULA) and user (FORMULA) nodes, which may be written as the self consistent equations: FORMULA where FORMULA are the relevant normalisations, and the abbreviation FORMULA indicates the set of nodes connected to FORMULA.\n",
      "In population dynamics, the notion of a particular graph with labelled edges is absent however, and the only the distribution of the two types of magnetisations are relevant.\n",
      "Stability Analysis To test the stability of the obtained solutions we consider both the appearance of non-negative entropy, and a stability parameter defined through a consideration of the fluctuation dissipation theorem.\n",
      "The first criteria that the entropy be non-negative is based on the fact that physically viable solutions in discrete systems must have non-negative entropy so that any solution found not meeting this criteria must be based on bad premises; replica symmetry is a likely source.\n",
      "The stability parameter FORMULA is defined in connection with the cavity method for spin glasses 1 CITE and tests local stability of the solutions.\n",

      "The spin glass susceptibility when averaged over instances may be defined FORMULA where FORMULA is the distance between two nodes in the factor graph, the inner average denotes the connected correlation function between these nodes, FORMULA describes the typical number of variables at distance FORMULA, and the outer average is over instances of the disorder (self-averaging part).\n",

      "We found that for all sparse ensembles there existed regimes with FORMULA for which only a single stable solution existed, although the equivalent dense systems are known to have two stable solutions in some range of FORMULA  1 CITE.\n",
      "In all single valued regimes we observed positive entropy, and a negative stability parameter.\n",
      "However, in cases of large FORMULA many features became more pronounced close to the dense case solution coexistence regime: notably the cusp in the stability parameter, gap between FORMULA and FORMULA and the gradient in FORMULA.\n",
      "Solution Coexistence Regimes FIGURE As in the case of dense CDMA 1 CITE, also here we observe a regime where two solutions, of quite different performance, coexist.\n",
      "In order to investigate the regime where two solutions coexist we investigated the states arrived at from random and ferromagnetic initial conditions (giving bad and good solutions respectively).\n",
      "Separate heuristic convergence criteria were found for the histograms, and these seemed to work well for the good solution.\n",
      "For the bad solution we simply present results after a fixed number of histogram updates (500) as all convergence criteria tested appeared either too stringent, to require experimentally inaccessible timescales, or did not capture the asymptotic values for important quantities like entropy.\n",
      "We believe 500 updates to be sufficiently conservative to capture the properties of these solutions however.\n",
      "Figure REF (a) shows the dependence of the bit error rate on the load, which is also equivalent to FORMULA.\n",
      "There is a monotonic increase in bit error rate with the load and the emergence and coexistence of two separate solutions above a certain point; in the case of the FORMULA code the point above which the two solutions coexist is FORMULA as indicated by the vertical dotted line.\n",
      "We use the regular code FORMULA to demonstrate the solution coexistence found above some FORMULA in various codes.\n",
      "The onset of the bimodal distribution can be identified by the divergence in the convergence time in the single solution regime (the time for the ferromagnetic and random histograms to converge to a common distribution).\n",
      "The time for this to occur, in a heuristically chosen statistic and accuracy, is plotted in figure REF (b).\n",
      "By a naive linear regression across 3 decades we found a power law exponent of FORMULA and a transition point of FORMULA, but cannot provide a goodness of fit measure to this data.\n",
      "This would represent the point at which at least two stable solutions co-exist.\n",
      "Beyond FORMULA only one stable solution is found from both random and ferromagnetic initial conditions, corresponding statistically to a continuation of the good solution.\n",
      "A solution which statistically resembles a continuation of the bad solution is occasionally arrived at from both initial conditions, this solution had a positive stability parameter and negative entropy – so is not a viable solution.\n",
      "Thus we predict a second dynamical transition in the region of FORMULA, as might be guessed by comparison with the dense case and observation of the trend in the stability parameter (see figure REF (c)).\n",
      "The stability results are presented in figure REF (c).\n",
      "Only two stable solutions were found in the region beyond this critical point and upto FORMULA, which we infer to be viable RS solutions (where entropy is positive).\n",
      "The bad solution upto 12dB has a well resolved negative value.\n",
      "The good solution has a negative value in its mean, but like other near ferromagnetic solutions investigated results are very noisy due to numerical issues relating to histogram resolution.\n",
      "Both capacity and spectral efficiency monotonically increase with the load as shown in figure REF (d).\n",
      "For the FORMULA code we see a separation of the two solutions at FORMULA (vertical dotted line.)\n",
      "The dashed lines correspond to a similar behaviour observed in the dense case (the range of interest is magnified in the inset.)\n",
      "A cross over in the entropy of the two distinct solutions, near FORMULA, is indicative of a second order phase transition.\n",
      "As in the dense case, only the solution of smallest spectral efficiency is thermodynamically relevant at a given FORMULA, although the other is likely to be important in decoding dynamics.\n",
      "The trends in the sparse case follow the dense case qualitatively, with the good solution having performance only slightly worse than the corresponding solution in the dense case (and vice versa for the bad solution).\n",
      "The entropy of the bad solution becomes negative in a small interval (spectral efficiency exceeds 2) although no local instability is observed.\n",
      "The static and dynamic properties of the histograms appear to be well resolved in this region.\n",
      "However, the negative entropy indicates an instability towards either a type of solution not captured within the RS assumption, or towards some metastable configuration.\n",
      "We will not speculate further, the bad solution is in any case thermodynamically subdominant in its low and negative entropy form.\n",
      "Our hypothesis is therefore that the trends in the sparse ensembles match those in the dense ensembles within the coexistence region and FORMULA continues to be valid for each of two distinct positive entropy solutions.\n",
      "The coexistence region for the sparse codes is however smaller than in the corresponding dense ensembles.\n",
      "Since our histogram updates mirror the properties of a belief propagation algorithm on a random graph we can suspect that the bad solution may have implications for the performance of belief propagation decoding in the coexistence region, and that convergence problems will appear near this region.\n",
      "In the user regular codes investigated the bad solution of the sparse ensemble outperforms the bad solution of the dense ensemble, and vice-versa for the good solution.\n",
      "Thus regardless of whether sparse decoding performance is good or bad, the dynamical transition point for the dense ensemble would corresponds to a FORMULA beyond which dense CDMA outperforms sparse CDMA at a particular load.\n",
      "Spectral Efficiency Lower Bound Numerical Results Finally we present figure REF, which shows the the mutual information between a single chip and transmitted bits for sparse ensembles of differing chip connectivity in the infinite FORMULA (zero noise) limit (REF).\n",
      "This shows that in expectation a chip drawn from the regular ensemble contains more information on the transmitted bits than a chip drawn from any other ensemble (including the Poissonian ensemble).\n",
      "The difference between the regular and Poissonian ensembles becomes relatively smaller as FORMULA increases.\n",
      "This appears consistent with the replica method results found at high FORMULA, although regular chip connectivity under performed by comparison with Poisson distributed chip connectivity in the low FORMULA regime, which was not anticipated by the single chip approximation.\n",
      "FIGURE Concluding Remarks Our results demonstrate the feasibility of sparse regular codes for use in CDMA.\n",
      "At moderate FORMULA it seems the performance of sparse regular codes may be very good.\n",
      "With the replica symmetric assumption apparently valid at practical FORMULA it is likely that fast algorithms based on belief propagation may be very successful in achieving the theoretical results.\n",
      "Furthermore for lower density sparse codes the problem of the coexistence regime, which limits the performance of practical decoding methods, seems to be less pervasive than for dense ensembles in the over saturated regime.\n",
      "A direct evaluation of the properties of belief propagation may prove similar results to those shown here.\n",
      "In the absence of replica symmetry breaking states it is normally true that belief propagation performs very well.\n",
      "However, to make best use of the channel resources it may be preferable to implement high load regimes in cases of high FORMULA, and so overcoming the algorithmic problems arising from the solution coexistence is a challenge of practical importance in this case.\n",
      "Other practical issues in implementation are certainly significant.\n",
      "Similar to the case of dense CDMA there are considerable problems relating to multipath, fading and power control, in fact it is known that these effects are more disruptive for the sparse codes, especially regular codes.\n",
      "However, certain situations such as broadcasting (one to many) channels and downlink CDMA, where synchronisation can be assumed, may be practical points for future implementation.\n",
      "There are practical advantages of the sparse case over dense and orthogonal codes in some regimes.\n",
      "The sparse CDMA method is likely to be particularly useful in frequency-hopping and time-hopping code division multiple access (FH and TH -CDMA) applications where the effect of these practical limitations is less emphasised.\n",
      "Extensions based on our method to cases without power control or synchronisation have been attempted and are quite difficult.\n",
      "A consideration of priors on the inputs, in particular the effects when sparse CDMA is combined with some encoding method may also be interesting.\n",
